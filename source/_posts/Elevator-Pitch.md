Something you don't do in an elevator pitch.

"I can tell you what happended during my university, it was blablabla"

"Hi, which floor you want to go, ok, you have missed your floor already."

"We are here to talk, forget about pressing the buttons."

"I have no idea why I am here."

"How about let me sing a song for you."

"No, I am waiting for you to introduce yourself."

"What do you think about the weather?"

"Have you watched the new movie?"

"You look like someone from an interview panel."
