No, I am not talking about Shannon's Noisy-Channel Coding Theorem.

By information, I mean news in general. Because we are exposed to too much information on a daily basis, most of them become noise in our life. For example, it won't hurt if you miss all the news for a week or a month. Your life goes on. And you know what, the most important news to you will find you anyway.
