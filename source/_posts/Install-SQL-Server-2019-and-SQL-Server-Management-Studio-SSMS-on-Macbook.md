As required by Database course, both software is expected to be installed on the laptop. Unfortunately, there are no mac versions for neither SQL Server 2019 nor SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). So, here is the plan. I will not talk about details, please use Google.

1. Register and get a free ‘Personal Use’ License for VMware Fusion
2. Install VMware Fusion and activate it using the license
3. Install Windows 10 on VMware Fusion
4. Install SQL Server 2019
5. Install SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

### Register and get a free ‘Personal Use’ License for VMware Fusion

Go to VMware Fusion website and create a personal account
https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/evalcenter?p=fusion-player-personal#tab_register

After your account is activated (email confirmed), login and you will see the license information and download packages link. Download it and install.

### Install VMware Fusion and activate it using the license

In the previous step, you should have received your personal license for VMware Fusion. Just use it.

### Install Windows 10 on VMware Fusion

Go to Microsoft website to download Windows 10 Disc Image (ISO File)
https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/software-download/windows10

Select edition: Windows 10
Select product language: English

Then you will have the ISO file, go and install it (without a Product Key) on VMware Fusion. Don't worry about Windows 10 activation (for now).

### Install SQL Server 2019

Since you have Windows 10, the rest will be easy.

Download the express version of SQL Server 2019 and install. (Choose basic mode when you install it, so you don't need to worry about the configurations.)

### Install SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

Here is the link.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-ca/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms

That's it.

Update:

If you are a student, your school might offer free Product Keys for windows 10 Education version.

Once you have the Product Key, activate your windows as you always do.
