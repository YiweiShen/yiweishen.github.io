Previously, I listened to the topic of remote working in one of the podcasts. It is something new to me if the work is entirely remote, but I would say to some extent, we need to get used to this concept of remote working with colleagues in a team. In the beginning, you might feel the pain that when you need to talk to someone to get things done, but other people are living in different time zones, which means they are still in their sleep. So you have to wait.

After the pandemic, I think people will realize that most of the office work can be done anyway at home. So finding a better way of collaboration among people in different places is one of the most important things to do. You can write more emails. Maybe.
