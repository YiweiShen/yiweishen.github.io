The book of Code Complete has been sitting on my book shelf for a long time. I always feel that it was a big book and the content is too much for my level. But these feelings were purely generated from the imagination because I never ever actually tried to read the book.

Until now. I began the reading. And it turns out the content makes sense to me in a lot of ways. I think it is considered as a classic book for a good reason.

It might take some time before I can finish the book, but I can say it now to anyone hesitate to read it, today is the day, just read it.
