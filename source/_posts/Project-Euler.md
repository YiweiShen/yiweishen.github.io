Got promotion on Project Euler to Level 2.  Yesterday, I tried to run some code on iOS Pythonista and actually answered 2 problems on the way home by taxi.  It feels good when I can leverage the Python power to crack some code.

By the way, even after adding https to the src of the external link of 163 music, it still seems not working.
