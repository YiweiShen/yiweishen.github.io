The coding experience on Leetcode is fantastic because you can always get instant feedback that your code is not working. Then you try again and get the feedback again that your codes fail. Back and forth serveral times until you get it.


To be honest, I like Project Euler more, because of its simplicity and the sense of art comes from the simplicity. Still, I think you need the Leetcode to practice to get a job. In this sense, it's a wonderful website that gives you hope of the employment.
