The world is watching Oprah's interview with Harry and Meghan. And the media is waiting for the royal family to respond.

Based on what I have witnessed (on television of course), they are being normal people and they are being a normal family with normal family issues. People may judge or gossip the royal family members because they are some kind of celebrity. That's fine when people don't have anything meaningful in daily conversasion why not talking about someone else's life.

But keep in mind they are just humans. At the end of the day, everyone has their own struggles in life, everyone has their own wars to fight.

I feel connected with the young couple, and I am very happy they got the courage to make the change.
