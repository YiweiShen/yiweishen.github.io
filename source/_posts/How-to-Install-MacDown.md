Me again, writing about this basic how to install MacDown, a simple tool for markdown.

I will not go through which is better for Mou and MacDown, you could choose Mou as well. OK.

#### First, install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh)
``` bash
$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
#### Second, install [Homebrew Cask](http://caskroom.io)
``` bash
$ brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask
```
#### Last but not least, install [MacDown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com)
``` bash
$ brew cask install macdown
```
The UI of Macdown is beautiful and I hope you enjoy it as I did.
