Raycast is a productivity tool for macOS. It allows you to quickly access files, folders, and applications. It's great, but only available on macOS. If you already use Raycast, you know how useful it is. If you don't, you should give it a try if you have a Mac.

For daily work, I also use Windows, and I was trying to implement a similar workflow on Windows. The thing I missed the most was the ability to search and open previously used workspaces in VS Code or remote machines with a few keystrokes.

You can guess my excitement when I found out about Microsoft PowerToys.

OK.

Enable VS Code search in the settings for PowerToys Run utility.

Then, you can use the shortcut `Alt + Space` to search for your workspaces.

```bash
{ THE_WORKSPACE_NAME_YOU_WANT_TO_OPEN
```

Now I have to find the equivalent of `zsh-autosuggestions` on Windows. Wish me luck.
