When I am trying to use the AT command in terminal, it prompt with such a message.

```bash
“Terminal” would like to administer your computer. 
```
```bash
Administration can include modifying passwords, networking and system settings.
```

It seems you have to grant futher access to the terminal so it can work properly.
