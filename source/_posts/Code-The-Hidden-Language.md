I am reading the book called Code: The hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software. It is quite informative and fun. It took some chapters to build some small pieces of hardware. At that moment you have no idea where this is going, because you don't know how to use this hardware. It did lead you somewhere in the end that you can put them together to build an entire computer. 

What a great experience. It helps me to understand how computers work and especially how things work in small scales and how things evolve historically. Thank you Charles Petzold, it's a good book.
