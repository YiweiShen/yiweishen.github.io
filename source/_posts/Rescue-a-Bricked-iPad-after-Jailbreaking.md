Somehow I decided to reset an useless old iPad (A1395, iOS 9.3.5) which had been jailbroken. After erasing all the content and settings, I found the iPad became bricked. The situation is that if you press the Power button, a few seconds of Apple logo shows, followed by a battery status in the center of the screen. And that's it, it just did not turn on.

## Solution

You need to make sure you have charged the iPad for several hours. It helps to rule out the cases when iPad refuses to turn on with low battery. If the battery is all good, there are two ways to rescue your iPad. Try the force-restart first.

### Force Restart

Hold down the Power button and the Home button at the same time for 10 seconds. You will see the Apple logo twice I guess. The second time when you see the logo, you can let go the two buttons and wait/pray for the iPad to turn on.

### Factory Reset in DFU mode

- Connect your iPad to a Mac (Sorry, I did not test if you can connect iPad to a Windows, chances are you can)
- On the iPad, hold down the Power button and the Home button at the same time, yes, for 10 seconds.
- Then, release the Power button but continue to hold the Home button for another 5 seconds.
- It should be entering DFU mode now. Choose Restore the factory settings.
- Wait for the iPad to reinstall everything once again.

I know a bricked iPad is useless. But, you know what, after rescuing the old iPad, I find the iPad is *still* useless anyway.
