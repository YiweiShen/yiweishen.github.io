I am not sure if I have mentioned this or not, CS50 courses are awesome. Great resources if you are looking for a place to start learning your CS knowledge. It is an entry-level course taught by David J. Malan in Harvard, and it is free. I think CS50 has motivated me in a way and convinced me that CS is something worth learning and doing as a career. Thanks to the internet, we can have the learning experience with such a wonderful teacher David Malan. Please google the course links or watch it on Youtube.
